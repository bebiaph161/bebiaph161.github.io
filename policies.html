	<h1>Meetings</h1>
	<p>
	  We have lectures on Monday and Wednesdays from 2:30-4 PM in 100 Broad. I understand that you may
	  miss a lecture from time to time, for graduate school
	  visits, etc., but I ask that you make every effort to come
	  to class. If you are concerned that you may out of necessity
	  miss too many lectures, please talk with me and we can try
	  to work out arrangements.</p>

	<br />
	<p>
	Lectures are a very important time for me to interface with
	  you. As we have discussions in lecture, we both learn, and I
	  get a good idea of how you are doing with the material. I
	  therefore often find it distracting when students use
	  laptops, tablets, and especially phones in lecture. As such, no phones or laptops may be out in lecture
	  unless we are specifically doing a computational exercise together. Tablets are allowed strictly for note-taking purposes. Cell
	  phones must be completely silenced and put away.</p>

	<br /><p>Lectures may not be recorded without my permission. If you
	  miss a lecture, I invite you to discuss what you have missed
	  with a classmate, your TAs, or with me.
	</p>

	<br />

	<p>
	  I also strongly recommend you attend my and/or the TA office
	  hours.
	</p>
	<br />


	<h1>Homework</h1>
	<p>Homework will be assigned roughly weekly, typically
	due on Wednesdays. Homework assignments are <a href="schedule.html">posted
	on the website</a>. The homeworks will not always have "right answers," but
	are always aimed at making you think about the central
	concepts of the course.  Following are homework policies.</p>
	<br />
	<ul class="publist">
		<li>Homeworks are submitted in PDF or Jupyter notebook format via <a href="https://caltech.instructure.com/courses/8003">Canvas</a>. If you handwrite and scan your solution, it must be legible. You will lose points for illegible homework. Mathematical expressions must be clearly presented with all variables defined. If you write it on paper, submit a clear scan or photos collated into a single PDF document. Occasionally, you will need to write code to solve some of the homework problems. You must submit all source code with your homework. </li>
  <li>Each homework <i>problem</i> is submitted as a single file. The filename is one of</li>
  	<ul class="pollist">
    	<li><font style="font-family:monospace">lastname_firstname_hw##.#.pdf</font>: A single PDF containing your solutions. This is the most common mode of submission.</li>
    	<li><font style="font-family:monospace">lastname_firstname_hw##.#.ipynb</font>: You may submit your homework as Juypter notebooks, if you wish. This is especially convenient for problems that require coding.</li>
			<li><font style="font-family:monospace">lastname_firstname_hw##.#.zip</font>: Sometimes you may need to submit a PDF, along with some source code. Everything should be zipped into a single file for submission.</li>  
	  </ul>
	<li>For example, a submission for the first homework problem would be submitted with a file name <font style="font-family:monospace";>SkłodowskaCurie_Marie_hw01.1.zip</font> containing the files <font style="font-family:monospace">SkłodowskaCurie_Marie_hw01.1.pdf</font> and <font style="font-family:monospace">SkłodowskaCurie_Marie_hw01.1.ipynb</font> as well as any image files used in the .ipynb document.
	</li>
  <li>Homeworks have a specified due time, usually at the start of lecture on Wednesdays. You are expected to turn homework in on time. No late homework will be accepted with exceptions outlined below.</li>
  	<ul class="pollist">
		<li>You have a total of six "grace days" you can use throughout the term. If you use grace days, your homework may be submitted late without penalty. A grace day is spent for each 24 hours, or portion thereof, that a given homework is late. For example, if a homework is due at 2:30 PM on Wednesday, but you turn it in at 6:30 PM on Friday, you spend three grace days, the first one being spent at 2:30 PM on Thursday, the second at 2:30 PM on Friday, and the third for the remaining four hours on Friday. After you spend six grace days for the term, you will not receive points toward your grade for any assignment submitted late.</li>
		<li>If you have an extended illness requiring you to spend more than six grace days, you need to provide a note from a health care provider.</li>
		<li>If you have a CASS accommodation, you need to communicate it to the instructor within the first week of class. If your accommodation allows for extra time on coursework, you need to let the instructor know you will be exercising that accommodation at least 24 hours before the homework is due.</li>
  	</ul>
  <li>You are encouraged to discuss the homework with your
  classmates, but your explanations and derivations must be
  your own.</li>
  <li>You may not use chatbots, large language models, or any other artificial intelligence for any purpose.</li>
  <li>You may not refer to homework problems from previous
  editions of this course. You also may not refer to solutions
  manuals, etc., for problems assigned from textbooks. If you come across a solution to a problem identical or similar to the one assigned, you cannot refer to that solution. In
  general, "homework by Google" is ill-advised. Slogging
  through a tough problem is often the best way to learn a
  concept, which is the whole point of the homework.</li>
  <li>You are welcome, and even encouraged, to work with your classmates on your homework. Note that <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/70374/">Ed</a> is a valuable resource to discuss the homework with the course staff and with your classmates. If you do work with a classmate or classmates, please indicate with whom you worked in your homework submission. In all cases, the work should be substantially your own, and you should have full mastery of whatever you submit. You may not copy solutions from classmates.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Final exam</h1>
	<p>There is currently no plan for a final exam, but I reserve the right to give one. You will have at least two weeks notice before administration of the exam if we give one. It may be a written exam or an oral exam.</p>

	<h1>Grading</h1>
	<p>Your grade in the course is based on homework (at least 70%), the final exam (at most 30%). The homeworks are all worth roughly the same number of points, but there may be some variation.</p><br />
	<p>For any regrade requests, the entire assignment or exam may be regraded.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>You must complete all homeworks and the final exam (if given) to pass the course. Note that you can turn in homework after all grace days are spent (but before the official end of the term) in order to ensure passage of the class, even though you will not receive points for the late homework. Homeworks or exams that are nullified due to Honor Code violations are not considered complete, and you will therefore not pass the class if you violate the Honor Code.</p>

    <h1>Course communications</h1>
	<p>Use the <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/70374/">class Ed</a> page for questions related to course topics and homework. Almost all of our mass communication with you will be through Ed, so be sure to set your Ed account to give you email alerts if necessary. You should use Ed for all communications except for issues of a personal nature, such as excuses for illness, in which case you should contact the course instructor directly via email.</p>

	<h1>Ediquette</h1>
	<p>When posting on Ed, please follow these guidelines:</p>
	<ul class="publist">
		<li>Your public posts should serve to help clarify concepts or ask about general directions. If you have specific questions that require showing much of your solution to a homework, make the post private, viewable only to the course staff.</li>
	<li>We will not be writing much computer code, but if you have a question about a coding bug make every attempt to provide a minimal example that demonstrates the problem. A minimal example strips out all other details beyond what is necessary to reproduce the problem or bug. Posting error messages without code is seldom helpful.</li>
	<li>While you are free to post anonymously to your classmates (course staff will always know who posts), we encourage you to post with your real name. This can spur discussions among students, which can be productive. This also spurs more conversation and results in faster answers to questions.</li>
	</ul>
